Hi Guys its been a while I havenâ€™t made any tool, so here is it. An awesome dev tool to unpack, repack any boot or recovery img and Automatically makes Materialised TWRP from any twrp img.

# Requirements :

* Any windows PC (32 bit and 64 bit both)
* Recovery, boot img
* Some basic knowledge about rom (very basic)
 
 # Features :

* Pretty small in size 
* Unpack Recovery, boot images
* Repack Recovery, boot images
* Automatically makes Materialised TWRP from a Normal TWRP image :0
* Easy to use and Portable

# How to use :

Just read the info given in the tool options :p

# Basic Info : 

This tool is simply written in batch script, coz it makes easy to write and execute, easy to handle and harmless file.
Also this tool is an open source project on github you can check it in the download sections from main webpage, so what I am trying to say is don't edit the tool and change my name and post it somewhere else, coz its my work I struggled.


Note:- Sometimes your materialised twrp made from the toolkit wont work, coz of some handled problem by the script. If something happens and TWRP won't work, no worry run the script again. Very rare cases it won't work.
